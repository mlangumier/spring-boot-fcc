# Tutorial

This project follows the tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp.org on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31KTdfRH6nY&t=288s), where we'll be able to note our workout sessions.

## Basics

Can run the project with VsCode (icon "play") or in terminal with Maven by typing `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

### Layers vs Feature

We can order our workspace the way we want.  
We can use the layer system (MVC), but files need to communicate throughout folders.  
We can use a feature system so files that need to communicate are close to each other.

### Defining a class

Instead of defining a class with all its getters and setter, we can simply use a `record`, which does all the work for us.
